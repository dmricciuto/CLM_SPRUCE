This file was created on March 31, 2017 set the model simulation for 100 years. The key purposes are (1) make all variables reasonable, such as oxygen, hdrogen, methane, carbon dioxide concentration along soil profile; (2) keep soil carbon and nitrogen consistent. Previous version of initial file has updated carbon and nitrogen pool for litter and soil, while the total carbon and oxygen etc were not updated.
